    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Galeto is a dish that's not only a local favorite but also very popular with tourists visiting my city. I remember enjoying it a lot, especially at restaurants run by Italian colonists, those immigrant families who came to South Brazil years ago. These Italian-run spots served up galeto featuring young chicken marinated in a blend of herbs, garlic, and then grilled. It is often served with a homemade mayonnaise type of dish, which is almost completely different to the mayonnaise you may be thinking about, which is also used a lot in Churrascos (barbecues), the dish was also complemented by pasta with a type of sauce and polentas! An example of these can be seen with the galeto on the picture.</p>
