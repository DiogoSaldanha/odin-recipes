    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Growing up in Brazil, I was surrounded by traditional dishes that were staples of our everyday meals. One of the most common house-made dishes we enjoyed during the week was the 'strogonoff', which, though originally from Russia, is a very common recipe in Brazil, specially in my state. Its easy preparation and delicious taste made it a go-to dish, reflecting the warmth and simplicity of Brazilian home cooking.</p>
