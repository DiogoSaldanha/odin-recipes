    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carreteiro is another dish common in South Brazil that always brings me back to my childhood. It's basically a mix of rice and beef, often made with leftovers from a barbecue, so it’s super flavorful and comforting. My family would cook it up with some onions, garlic, and spices, and sometimes top it with fresh parsley or a spicy salsa. This dish has its roots with the gauchos who used to make it on long cattle drives, so it’s got this great, rugged vibe. It reminds me of cozy family meals and those awesome Gaucho traditions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 kg of charque (salted and dried beef)</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped
        </li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch of green seasoning (like parsley and chives)
        </li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>5 large cups of rice</li>
        <li>10 and a half cups of boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, there are some crucial things to note: a typical Gaucho carreteiro never needs additional salt, as you shouldn't leave the meat soaking until it loses its flavor just to add salt later. The amount of olive oil wasn’t specified because it depends on the amount of fat in the meat.</li>
        <li>Cut the charque into small cubes, no larger than 1 cm³, and cook the charque in water until it’s very salty but still tolerable to the taste.</li>
        <li>If the charque is too salty and after some time of boiling the flavor still isn't right, it’s best to change the water and bring it to a new boil.</li>
        <li>After boiling, drain all the water and fry the charque in olive oil, using just enough so that as it fries, it renders its own fat and fries in that.</li>
        <li>Let it fry until well browned, then add the onions, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, and green seasoning.</li>
        <li>Let everything fry well until it starts to dry out, then add the rice and fry a little more.</li>
        <li>Add the boiling water, stir well to mix the ingredients evenly, as you won’t be able to stir it anymore after this point.</li>
        <li>Wait for it to come to a boil again, then lower the heat and let it cook until the water has evaporated.</li>
    </ol>
